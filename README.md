Features:

Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Displays the result on the calculator screen.
Includes a clear button to reset the display and a delete button to correct errors.
Includes decimal point support also.
Future Enhancements:Implement support for more complex calculations (e.g., order of operations, parentheses ).
Enhances user experience with features like error handling (division by zero), history of calculations.
